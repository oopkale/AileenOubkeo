<!-- The best way to do this is to search using the navbar. Put in a term OR a class tag -->
<!-- A few pages that should be helpful to start out with.... 
  Use https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/content/typography/ to adjust the display (size, etc)
  
  Use https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/customize/color/ to adjust color attributes 
  (there's also different pages with background color, opacity, etc )-->

        <h2>Evidence</h2>
       
        <li>According to “The Impact of Fast Fashion on the Environment” it takes 3 thousand liters of water to produce a single cotton shirt and 20% of the waste water globally is from the water used to dye each shirt.</li>
        <li>The clothes that are made are with low quality and will wear out within a few washes. In 2019, 62 million metric tons of apparel were consumed. </li>
        <li>The fashion industry is responsible for a fair amount of carbon emissions released each year. If they maintain the course they have been taking now, an increase of 50% in carbon emissions is expected to rise.</li>
