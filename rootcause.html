    <h1>Root Causes</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>The root causes of this issue is that people are buying clothes with low quality material which is made of dyes and fibers that are polluting our waters and releasing micro-fibers that can be toxic. </li>
        <li>Fast Fashion is caused by companies producing high demand clothes with low quality in order to take advantage of a trend to maximize their profits.</li>
    </ul>
