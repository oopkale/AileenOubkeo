    <h1>Root Causes</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>One of the causes to fast fashion are people not getting rid of clothes in an efficient manner. When the clothes are being worn out, they are not being donated and thrown into landfills instead.</li>
        <p>Evidence: "The fast fashion model encourages consumers to view clothing as disposable." (The global environmental injustice of fast fashion)</p>
        <p>Explanation: When the Fast Fashion world encourages their consumers to dispose of their clothes, they are trying to increase their profits because then the consumer would buy more. This hinders the comsumer from donating and instead, throwing their clothes away.</p>
            <br>
        <p>"In fact, the average American throws away approximately 80 pounds of clothing and textiles annually, occupying nearly 5% of landfill space."  (The global environmental injustice of fast fashion)
        </p>
        <p>Explanation: This number proves that American consumers are not donating their clothes and properly disposing but instead, throwing them in the landfill and contributing to the fast fashion problem.</p>
        <p>Implications: Clothes should be donated and given to thrid world contries that cannot afford it.</p>
        <li>Fast Fashion is caused by companies producing high demand clothes with low quality in order to take advantage of a trend to maximize their profits.</li>
        <p>Evidence: "In the two decades since the fast fashion business model became the norm for big name fashion brands, increased demand for large amounts of inexpensive clothing has resulted in environmental and social degradation along each step of the supply chain."  (The global environmental injustice of fast fashion)</p>
        <p>Explanation: Big name for fashion brands are becoming more prominent in our world, it is contributing to our issue because it means that they are creating low quality clothes that wear out within a few wears causing people to throw them away. </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        "Consumers in high income countries can do their part to promote global environmental justice by buying high-quality clothing that lasts longer, shopping at second-hand stores, repairing clothing they already own, and purchasing from retailers with transparent supply chains."  (The global environmental injustice of fast fashion)
        </p>
        <p>
        Explanation: This implies that the clothing is not made with quality in places like America. 
        </p>
        <p>Implications: this means that clothing should be made with higher qulaity fibers that take time and care to make. It should be made with a specific type of fiber that doesn't pollute the waters. 
        </p>
