    <h1>Case Study</h1>
    <p> ThredUP is most effective in saving money, raising awareness through their millions of engaged customers, and saving pounds of carbon emissions being released into the atmosphere. They claim, “EVERY TIME YOU SHOP SECONDHAND INSTEAD OF NEW, YOU REDUCE CARBON EMISSIONS BY 85%”</p>
    <br>
    <p>They offer an option to donate and have a system where you pick up a “kit” and fill it with gently used clothing and then drop it off at a post station. I think it would be effective and people will be likely to do this if they have their employees that come to pick up the “kits”. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>I think I could have a page that connects people to other sites that do offer these services like pick up their old clothes or their items to their house or even google maps that will connect them to thrift stores where they can shop. </p>
