    <h1 class="text-center">Case Study</h1>
    <ul> ThredUP is most effective in saving money, raising awareness through their millions of engaged customers, and saving pounds of carbon emissions being released into the atmosphere. They claim, “Every time you shop secondhand instead of new, you reduce carbon emissions by 85%”</ul>
    <br>
    <ul> The business offers an option to donate and have a system where you pick up a “kit” and fill it with gently used clothing and then drop it off at a post station. I think it would be effective and people will be likely to do this if they have their employees that come to pick up the “kits”.
    </ul>
    <br>
    <ul>I think I could have a page that connects people to other sites that do offer these services like pick up their old clothes or their items to their house or even google maps that will connect them to thrift stores where they can shop. </ul>

    <p class="fw-bold"> ThredUp is most effective in saving money, raising awareness through their millions of engaged customers, and saving pounds of carbon emissions being released into the atmosphere. </p>
    <p>In 2009, the co-founder & CEO James Reinhart realized he had a closet full of clothes he didn’t wear. He wasn’t alone. He knew there was value in those clothes, and “looking back at that moment, I certainly didn’t appreciate how that insight could eventually upend how we look at innovation in retail, the apparel industry, and our environment.”</p>

            </p>

            <p class="text-center"> Big clothing company names try to take advantage of trends to maximize profits and will produce large amounts of clothing in a short amount of time and as a result, they will make clothes with low quality. It is better to shop at stores with higher quality clothes and invest your money in clothes that you are likelier to wear for several years. </p>

        <p class="text-center">I wanted to have a site that surveyed people's habits regarding their fashion and make recommendations for better alternatives.
