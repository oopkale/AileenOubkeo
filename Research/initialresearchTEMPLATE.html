        <h2>Evidence</h2>
       <h1>Impact</h1>
        <li>According to “The Impact of Fast Fashion on the Environment” it takes 3 thousand liters of water to produce a single cotton shirt and 20% of the waste water globally is from the water used to dye each shirt.</li>
        <li>The clothes that are made are with low quality and will wear out within a few washes. In 2019, 62 million metric tons of apparel were consumed. </li>
        <li>The fashion industry is responsible for a fair amount of carbon emissions released each year. If they maintain the course they have been taking now, an increase of 50% in carbon emissions is expected to rise.</li>
        <h1>Perspective</h1>
        <li>H&M is well known for its contribution to fast fashion and making clothes that are cheaply made. According to 
          Doctor Christina Dean, founder and CEO of Redress has commented that despite H&M for being caught contributing to fast fashion, "we should not just blame H&M and Bestseller, as they have been the only ones that got caught, while luxurious brands are the ones that even burn leather."
